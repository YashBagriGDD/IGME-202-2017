Assignment: 
Asteroids

Description: 
Move the ship around and shoot the asteroids. As you clear the screen more asteroids will appear.
Try to get as far as you can for the highest score! If you run out of lives game will reset.

Up Arrow - Accelerate
Left Arrow - Turn Left
Right Arror - Turn Right
Space Bar - Shoot
Escape - Exit Game

Above and Beyond:
Added sound effects to the asteroids, ship death, and shoot along with back ground music.
Added a wave system that will generate more asteroids as the wave is cleared.
High score system that is saved. 

Known Issues: 
No invincibility frames on player so a crash can result in you being catapulted into another asteroid leading to a chain hit.
Screen wrap doesn't take place till a bit off the screen so if the asteroid is moving in a certain way it can end up moving across the screen with a very little bit of it visible.
Cannot Shoot while accelerating and turning.

Notes:
Sprites recreated by me.
